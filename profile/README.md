This is how we make fleets safer.
---------------------------------

### We are determined to reduce preventable deaths and injuries in and around fleet vehicles. Our goal, like yours, is zero accidents.

How do we do it? The Safe Fleet Business System (SBS). It’s a suite of customer-focused processes we use within Safe Fleet. When used consistently across the organization, it enables us to achieve our goal of total safety for fleets of every type—School Bus, Transit Bus and Rail, RV, Fire, EMS, Industrial, Military, Work Truck, Truck and Trailer, Waste & Recycling, and Law Enforcement.
